# Github Assignment Response

In this semester, Github has been the most challenging concept for me. 
The statistics department never introduced us to this software although I think it could 
have been used for many group projects. Most of the time, we shared code and figures 
though email, but that is wildly inefficient. Sharing individual r code meant that only
one person could work on the file at a time or we had to meet in-person to code together. 
Even though there is a learning curve with Github, this software makes working together
much easier. I am still working on figuring out this platform, but being able to work 
together remotely is very awesome. At the moment, I am struggling with how to work at 
the same time without creating too many conflicts to merge our work. If a partner and
I access the same file or forget to push a change, could we lose work or have to 
spend more time addressing conflicts to merge? I also struggle with when to use a 
testing branch off of the main branch in terms of our project, but all in all, this
software is really interesting. I hope to get better familiar with Github and use it 
in further projects.
