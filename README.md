# Github Assignment Response

In this semester, Github has been the most challenging concept for me. 
The statistics department never introduced us to this software although I think it could 
have been used for many group projects. Most of the time, we shared code and figures 
though email, but that is wildly inefficient. Sharing individual r code meant that only
one person could work on the file at a time or we had to meet in-person to code together. 
Even though there is a learning curve with Github, this software makes working together
much easier.
